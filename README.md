> Create React App with SSR example

This project show how to implement SSR with a simple React App project.

## Do yourself

If you already have a project, I can help you. Just follow the above steps.

### Separate React backend from frontend

Create a file `index.ssr.jsx` on `src` folder.
This file will contain your [StaticRouter](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/guides/ssr).

### Create your ambient for serve React

You can create a `express` server and then import your `React` string rendered by `react-dom/server`.

## Building

### Eject react-scripts

You will need to eject react-scripts because we will use webpack to generate server rendering build and it's easiest to create jest tests.

```sh
yarn eject
```

### Create webpack for each ambient

First, create a webpack to deal with `index.ssr.jsx` as an entry, because you will need basically everything `react-scripts` does to render a React App.
You can just copy the ejected `config/webpack.config.js` or import into your new webpack file.
Then, change the entry of the webpack to `index.ssr.jsx`.

# Commands

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```
